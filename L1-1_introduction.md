# computational photography

- figure out how light from the images is used to generate photographs
- how computation impacts photography -> artistic express
- emphasis on technology that impact this pipeline of light to photographs

# course Structure
- video lectures w/ tech concepts
- mini-quizzes
*assignment due every week*
  - interact with material in different ways
  - coding included in some, which suggests that it's not in all of them?
- midterm test
- final project
  - applying the course concepts

_have fun computing with photographs_

# class requirements
computational pipeline of capturing light and processing data
- mathematics (linear algebra, calculus, probability)
- computing
  - within browser
  - openCV / python / C++ OR
  - matlab / octave
- camera
  - could be useful (nothing advanced)
  - images will be provided

*goal: opening black boxes on photography*

# module 1: introduction
- what is computational photography?
- examples of computational photography to provide context
- overview of the scope of computational, with respect to other disciplines and its potential impact
- assignment: getting set up and sharing some pictures!

# module 2: image processing and analysis
- digital image representation (what file formats it saves as?)
- pixel/point processes for images
- smoothing and filtering images
- extract features from images
- assignments: experiements with image filtering and detection

# module 3: cameras, optics, and sensors
- pin-hole camera
- importance of optics
- how does a camera work?
- sensors
- assignments: epsilon photography & make your own camera obscura

# module 4: image blending/merging
- sampling and frequencies
- image blending
- image features (selecting features in multiple images that allow seamless joining of photos)
- homework: exercise on image blending

# module 5: doing computational photography
- panoramas
- high dynamic range (HDR)
- image editing
- Assignment: experiments with HDR/panoramas

# module 6: Extending to video
- video
- video textures
- video stabilization
- homework: experiments with video textures

# module 7: computational cameras
- computation cameras have additional features and capabilities
  - light field cameras
  - multi-view cameras
  - projector camera Systems

# module 8 : advanced topics & special topics
- newer camera Technologies
- blur/deblur
- social/crowd photography
- final project

# expectations
- not a photography class
  -  won't be teaching basics of photography
  - technology-related content
- hands-on activities class
  - lots of learning by doing
