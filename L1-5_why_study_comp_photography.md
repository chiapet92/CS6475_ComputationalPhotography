*how computational photography relates to the broader photography discipline*

# goals
1. pervasiveness of photography
2. how comp photography relates to other disciplines
3. comp photography vs photography

# (film) camera process
novel camera :
  light -> generalized optics -> sensor -> processing

computational camera process:
  light -> generalized optics (ray bender) -> generalized sensor (ray sampler)

# so why study cameras
- almost everyone has a camera
  - they are becoming small and more ubiquitous
- significant improvements in optics
  - field of applied optics has studied every aspect of the lens
- better, cheaper sensors (CCD/CMOS)
  - sensor electronics has its own field now

# cameras are pervasive
- camera phones
  - widest selling electronic platform
- further expanded by new platforms
  - camera implementations can be found on:
    - google earth, youtube, flickr
    - text, speech, music, images, video
- key element for art, research, products, social-computing

# camera sales (film)
- stead growth since 1950s, steep drop-off since 1997 because of the advent of digital cameras
- digital cameras have been on decline recently because they are supplanted by camera phones

# photos taken
- there's been a recent boom in # of photos taken
- ~10% of the photos taken ever has been in the last 2-3 years
# Single Lens Reflex (SLR) to Camera phones?
- DSLR advantages
  - more light
  - depth of field
  - shutter lag
  - control field of view
  - better glass
  - others (flash, manual, modes)
- phone advantages
  - computation
  - data
  - programmers (APIs can be applied on photographs real-time)

# film to digital
- film and digital cameras have roughly the same features and controls
  - zoom & focus
  - aperture & exposure
  - shutter release & advance
  - one shutter press = one snapshot

# computational photography extends FP/DP
- for FP/DP we can use, but CP allows us to change:
  - optics, illumination, sensor, movement
  - exploit wavelength, speed, depth, polarization, etc.
  - probes, actuator, network

# computational photography benefits
CP has better specification and support for :
- dynamic range
- vary focus point-by-point
- field of view vs. resolution
- exposure time & frame rate

# evolution of cameras
- 1839 : earliest embodiment of a camera
  - lens + chemical film
- 1907 : basics of saving images into prints
- 1986 : instant disposable camera
- 1991 : digital SLR
- 2000 : mobile cellphone camera

# images in news
-  kennedy assassination
- rodney king beatings in LA
- 9/11
- 7/7 london bombings
- virginal tech massacre
- michael richards
- russian meteor

# kinds of images
- participatory data
  - handheld citizen
- institutional imagery
  - satellite, airborne, recon, UAV
- incidental
  - security cameras, ATMs
*different POVs*

# Evolution of photography
cameras are cheaper
tech is ubiquitous
comic about "jobs being lost to technology"

# computer vision and computer graphics
computer vision:
  images (2D) <-> geometry (3D) + photometry (colors and appearances)
    using 2D and infer 3D
computer graphics:
  using Geometry + photometry to display images (2D)

# ultimate camera
- human vision system
- all camera is is an imitation of the human eye

# the emerging field
- what will a camera look like in the future?
- what novel images can we get? what are their uses?
- how will the next billion cameras change the social culture?
  *beast with a billion eyes*
- how can we augment the camera to support the best "image search" ?
- how will ultra-high-speed/resolution imaging change our usage?
- how will autonomous and robotic cameras impact the photographic pipeline?
- what are the opportunities in pervasive, experimental recording?

# summary
- pervasive of cameras
- comp photography in the context of computer graphics, computer vision, image processing and optic/sensors
- comp photography vs trad photography and digital photography
- a need to study comp photography
