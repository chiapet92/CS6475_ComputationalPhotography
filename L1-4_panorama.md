# panorama

# objectives
1. learning what steps are required
2. identify the 5 elements of computational photography that are used in making a panorama

# panorama pipeline
FOV is measured in width X height (by degrees)

## 1.taking pictures
- for a panorama, pictures are taken by rotating the camera around a fixed axis
- there are more advanced methods like a special equipment that rotates and takes pictures at fixed intervals
*there are be different kinds of panoramas*
  - planar
  - rotational
  - vertical
  - path/route/multi-view *not from a single location and rotated*

## 2. detecting and matching
- you need to have some sort of common overlap in over to stitch the photos together

## 3. warping
- change images that are slightly misaligned between images

## 4. fade, blend, or cut
- figure out which pixels from which images should be visible

## 5. cropping (optional)
- cut image to get rid of badly fitting edges/corners
