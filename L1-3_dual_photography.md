# dual photography

- using a computer controlled light source + camera, creating a products that was not possible previously

# novel illumination
- capture rays of light w/ a photocell
- use a projector to externally illuminate the scene (controllable light source)
  - also use a mesh modulator (controllable aperture) in front of the projector

# novel camera
- replacing the photocell w/ camera
- also put a modulating aperture (controllable aperture) in front of the camera

# reflective property of ray of light
 - light transport : mathematics behind what happens when a ray of light hits a surface
 - reflection of light depends on the surface type:
  - specular (mirror)
  - diffuse (matte)

# stanford dual photography
- generate an image from the perspective of the projector
- dual photography is measuring the light transport to generate the dual image
- generate the face of the playing card by measuring the change in light intensity post-bounce after a modulator

# Summary
- introduced computational photography terms of novel illumination, novel camera, generalized optics, aperture, sensor, rays, and pixels
- studied a core computational photography example (dual photography)
