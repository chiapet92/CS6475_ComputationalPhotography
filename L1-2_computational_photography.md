# what is photography?
- science and art of creating images by recording light
- via image sensor or chemical reaction

The picture is taken thru a LENS, which is used to funnel and direct the light on the medium

# what is computational photography?
- cameras are high-end devices
- camera + computer = computational photography
  - attach computation on camera (camera 2.0, aka. Frankencamera)

# computational photography combines...
- computing
- digital sensors
- modern optics
- actuators
- smart light
*all of this "escapes" the limitations of traditional film*

# limitations of traditional film cameras
- requires a darkroom / chemicals
- constraints of 12-24-36 pictures / roll
- no instant gratification *biggest drawback of film*
- sensitivity of film

# computational photography enabled imaging
- unbounded dynamic range
- variability
  - focus
  - depth of field
  - resolution
  - lighting
  - reflectance
- supports and enhances the medium of photography by widening the capability range

# elements of computational photography
- 3D scene decomposition
  -> creates (1) illumination
  -> (2) optics
  -> (3) sensor
  -> (4) processing
  -> (5) display
  -> (6) user

*computation can be embedded in all aspects of these elements to support photography*

# computational photography = rays to pixels
novel illumination = lights -> aperture -> generalized optics -> rays to 3d scene
novel camera = rays from 3d scene -> generalized optics -> aperture -> sensor -> processing -> display

# Summary
1. computational photography "computationalizes" the entire workflow of photography
2. rays to pixels
3. generalizing control (actuation) of elements' illumination, optics/aperture, sensor, processing, display, and sharing
4. "enhances" the photographic process
